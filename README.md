Streamlining Email and Content Creation

Scenario: Preparing for a speaking engagement while managing daily communications

AI Collaboration Process:
• Interview: Use AI to extract key information about the speaking engagement and
audience preferences
• Scaffold: Develop templates for emails and presentation content with AI assistance
• S.E.A. application:
Streamline: Automate routine email responses
Enrich: Enhance presentation content with AI-assisted research
Accelerate: Rapidly generate and refine presentation slides

Outcome: Achieve 10x speed in communication tasks and 10x impact in presentation quality

Key Concepts Applied:
• Targeted knowledge extraction
• Context and detail provision
• Four Essential Components:
− Extract (audience info)
− Structure (email templates)
− Explore (content ideas)
− Orchestrate (overall preparation process)



Rapid Professional Adaptation and Meeting Preparation

Scenario: Preparing for meetings in unfamiliar industries or with new clients

AI Collaboration Process:
• Interview: Use AI to extract key industry trends, client information, and personal
knowledge gaps
• Scaffold: Develop an AI-assisted rapid learning and preparation framework
• S.E.A. application:
− Streamline: Quickly process and summarize vast amounts of industry data
− Enrich: Generate insights by connecting new information with existing knowledge
− Accelerate: Rapidly produce relevant questions, talking points, and analogies for
effective communication

Outcome: 10x faster acquisition of relevant knowledge and 10x increase in meeting preparedness
and communication effectiveness

Key Concepts Applied:
• Four Quadrants of Knowledge (rapidly moving information from unknown to known)
• From tool to partner (AI as a collaborative learning partner)
• Achieving previously impossible tasks through advanced AI collaboration





Cognitive Load Management and Task Switching

Scenario: Managing diverse daily tasks and minimizing mental strain from context switching

AI Collaboration Process:
• Interview: Collaborate with AI to understand personal work patterns, priorities, and
cognitive load factors
• Scaffold: Create an AI-powered daily schedule and task management system
• S.E.A. application:
− Streamline: Automate task prioritization and schedule optimization
− Enrich: Provide context-specific information for quick task transitions
− Accelerate: Rapidly brief on upcoming tasks to minimize switching costs

Outcome: 10x reduction in cognitive load from task switching and 10x improvement in daily
Productivity

Key Concepts Applied:
• Displacement vs. replacement of workflows (reimagining task management)
• Context and detail in AI collaboration (for effective task briefings)
• Teamwork with AI (orchestrating multiple AI tools for comprehensive task management)

4. Educational Support and Knowledge Transfer

Scenario: Assisting children with homework and adapting personal expertise to new domains

AI Collaboration Process:
• Interview: Use AI to analyze learning needs, knowledge gaps, and potential cross-domain
applications
• Scaffold: Develop AI-assisted frameworks for educational support and knowledge transfer
• S.E.A. application:
− Streamline: Quickly understand and break down complex assignments or
new concepts
− Enrich: Generate analogies and examples to explain difficult ideas across domains
− Accelerate: Rapidly create practice materials or apply existing frameworks to
new fields

Outcome: 
10x faster educational support and knowledge adaptation, with 10x improvement in
understanding and application

Key Concepts Applied:
• Targeted knowledge extraction through effective AI communication
• Four Quadrants of Knowledge (identifying and filling knowledge gaps)
• From efficiency to transformation (reimagining learning and knowledge transfer processes)
