What is the Community Health Index (CHI) and how is it calculated?
The Community Health Index (CHI) is a single metric used to represent the overall well-being of a community, specifically the PM Mentality community in the provided sources. It acknowledges the multidimensional nature of community health by incorporating weighted scores from five core dimensions: Engagement Vitality (25%), Community Culture (25%), Knowledge Exchange (20%), Member Journey (15%), and Leadership Health (15%). To calculate the CHI, each key indicator within these dimensions is first converted to a 0-100 scale based on its current value compared to predefined warning and healthy thresholds. A dimension average is then calculated from these indicator scores, and the Overall CHI is the weighted average of all dimension scores.
What are some key SMART goals for the PM Mentality community's onboarding process?
The PM Mentality community has defined specific SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound) goals for its onboarding process to ensure new members are quickly integrated and engaged. Key examples include ensuring 90% onboarding checklist completion within 72 hours of joining, achieving a 75% first-week activity rate (such as Slack posts, polls, or event RSVPs), and generating at least 1 qualitative feedback point per new member in their first week. Another important goal is attaining 100% Slack and Coda access within 24 hours of the invitation being sent.
How does the PM Mentality community use gamification to encourage engagement?
Gamification is a core tool in the PM Mentality community's engagement strategy, applied during both onboarding and ongoing participation. Members earn XP (Experience Points) for various activities, such as making an introductory post, reacting to threads, commenting, interacting with mentors, and submitting feedback forms. This progress is tracked using tools like Trello and Coda, where members can earn fun badges (e.g., "XP God," "Just Hatched") and see their progress visualized. This system aims to reinforce positive habits through variable rewards, micro-challenges, and public visibility of XP.
What is the "3-Layer Cake Intro" and how is it used?
The "3-Layer Cake Intro" is a structured framework designed to guide new members in crafting their introductory posts. It encourages members to divide their introduction into three distinct sections: "fun fluff," "substance," and "realness." This framework aims to facilitate more engaging and comprehensive introductions that help other members connect with the new individual on multiple levels. It is presented as a method for new members to share about themselves during the initial onboarding phase.
What role do mentors play in the PM Mentality community and how is their performance measured?
Mentors are crucial to the PM Mentality community's success, serving as experienced members who guide and support newer members (mentees). Their responsibilities include facilitating knowledge sharing and fostering a supportive community culture. Their performance and impact are tracked quarterly using specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These KPIs include Mentee Response Rate (with a target of 95%+ responding within 48 hours), achieving 100% first engagement with mentees within 3 days, maintaining a high Feedback Quality Rating (Peer) (targeting an average of 4.5+/5), ensuring high Mentor Pulse Participation (targeting 90%+), and contributing to the community's Knowledge Base (with a target of at least 1 contribution per cycle).
Describe the closed-loop feedback system implemented in the PM Mentality community.
The PM Mentality community employs a systematic closed-loop feedback system to continuously improve and demonstrate that member input is valued. This process involves five key steps: 1. Collection & Categorization of feedback from various channels; 2. Pattern Identification to group similar feedback and identify trends; 3. Impact Assessment to evaluate the potential effect of feedback themes; 4. Action Planning to develop strategies (quick wins, strategic initiatives, etc.) based on the feedback; and 5. Closing the Loop by documenting actions taken, communicating changes to the community, and acknowledging those who provided the feedback. This ensures feedback leads to tangible improvements.
What is the distinctive tone and voice used in the PM Mentality internal planning documents?
The internal planning documents for the PM Mentality community are characterized by a distinctive, self-aware, playful, sarcastic, and high-energy tone. This deliberate style, often involving nicknames for the Community Engagement Specialist like "Miss Big Brain" or "Nerdzilla" and incorporating humor, is intended as an "antidote to boring onboarding guides" and aims to create a more engaging internal environment for the team developing and managing the community strategy. The tone is described as both fun ("хем забавен") and purposeful ("хем целенасочен").
What is the purpose of having re-engagement strategies for inactive members, and what are some associated metrics?
The primary purpose of having re-engagement strategies is to reactivate inactive or "ghosting" members within the PM Mentality community. This is important for maintaining overall community health and maximizing member participation. Specific goals and metrics are tied to these efforts, such as achieving a 50% re-engagement response rate from inactive members and a 30% ghost-to-checklist conversion rate (getting inactive members to complete the onboarding checklist after re-engagement). The strategies often involve targeted communication sequences, "FOMO Bombs" (inviting members to exclusive events), and "Bonus Moves" like awarding "Comeback Kid" badges.
