### Want a filter system too?

If you're using **Coda, Airtable, or Notion**, I can structure:

*   dropdown filters for **Platform**, **Audience**, **Type**, **Status**
    
*   buttons for "Use Template" or "Send via Workflow"
    

* * *

**Next moves ‚Äî choose one:**

*   üìÑ Google Sheet export
    
*   üìò Notion-ready database
    
*   üß± Coda live doc with filters, views, automations
    
*   üîó Airtable view if you're doing form ‚Üí action flows
    

How do you want it prepped? Or want me to just start one and hand you the link to take over?
