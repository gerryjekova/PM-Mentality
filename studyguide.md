Quiz Answer Key
1.
The five core health dimensions are Engagement Vitality, Community Culture, Knowledge Exchange, Member Journey, and Leadership Health. These dimensions are weighted differently to contribute to the final CHI score.
2.
The Overall CHI is calculated by first converting each indicator within the five dimensions to a 0-100 scale based on its current value relative to defined warning and healthy thresholds. Then, a dimension average is calculated from its indicators' scores, and the Overall CHI is the weighted average of these dimension scores.
3.
Two specific SMART goals are ensuring 90% onboarding checklist completion within 72 hours of joining and achieving a 75% first-week activity rate. Another goal is to generate 1 qualitative feedback point per new member in the first week.
4.
The "3-Layer Cake Intro" is a structured framework for new member introductions in the community. It encourages members to include "fun fluff," "substance," and "realness" in their introductory posts to facilitate more engaging introductions.
5.
Gamification is integrated through XP points awarded for various activities like intro posts, reactions, and feedback. Trello labels and Coda views track XP and signify progress, using terms like "XP God" or "Just Hatched."
6.
Mentors are responsible for guiding and supporting mentees, sharing knowledge, and fostering community culture. Their performance is tracked quarterly using KPIs such as Mentee Response Rate, First Engagement, Feedback Quality Rating, Mentor Pulse Participation, and Contribution to Knowledge Base.
7.
The weekly feedback synthesis process involves Collection & Categorization, Pattern Identification, Impact Assessment, Action Planning, and Closing the Loop. This ensures feedback is systematically gathered, analyzed, prioritized, and acted upon with communication back to contributors.
8.
Besides general engagement (# of intro replies), metrics are tracked for Experiments (engagement delta), Feedback (response count, actionable items), Learning Hub (resource usage), and Community Voice (blocker themes surfaced).
9.
The internal planning documents use a playful, sarcastic, and high-energy tone, often using nicknames for the Community Engagement Specialist. This tone is a deliberate "antidote to boring onboarding guides" and aims to create a more engaging internal environment.
10.
The primary purpose of re-engagement strategies is to reactivate inactive or "ghosting" members. This involves sequences of communication and incentives, aiming to bring members back into active participation and contribute to overall community health metrics.
Essay Format Questions
1.
Analyze the PM Mentality community's phased engagement strategy, specifically focusing on the transition from Onboarding & Initial Engagement to Developing Engagement & Feedback Loops. Discuss the key activities and goals associated with each phase and how they contribute to long-term member retention.
2.
Evaluate the importance of the Community Health Index (CHI) within the PM Mentality framework. Explain how the CHI acts as a comprehensive metric and discuss the significance of its five weighted dimensions in providing a holistic view of community well-being.
3.
Discuss the role of gamification in the PM Mentality community. Provide specific examples of how XP points, badges, and other gamified elements are used during onboarding and ongoing engagement, and analyze their intended impact on member behavior and habit reinforcement.
4.
Examine the closed-loop feedback system implemented in the PM Mentality community. Describe the process for collecting, analyzing, and acting upon member feedback, and explain why this systematic approach is crucial for continuous improvement and building trust.
5.
Analyze the distinctive tone and voice used in the PM Mentality internal planning documents. Discuss the intended purpose of this tone, how it contrasts with traditional documentation, and provide examples of how it is manifested in the source material.
