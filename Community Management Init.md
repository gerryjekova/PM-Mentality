## **🧪 EXECUTION \+ VISUALIZATION PLAN FOR THE KPI DASHBOARD**

We're building:

* **KPI Dashboard (interactive \+ visual)**

* Based on: **Coda** or **Notion**, whichever you’re using (but I’ll write it for Coda since your doc screams “Coda cultist”)

* Visuals: Progress bars, emoji indicators, auto-updating stats, etc.

---

### **🧱 BASE STRUCTURE (Coda Tables Needed)**

#### **1\. `🎯 Member Data`**

| Name | Join Date | Checklist % | First Post Date | Feedback Submitted | Mentor Assigned | Events Attended |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

#### **2\. `🔥 Engagement Logs`**

| Member | Action | Date | Type (Post, RSVP, Feedback, DM, etc) |

#### **3\. `📊 KPI Tracker`**

| Metric | Goal | Current | Status |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Checklist Completion Rate | 90% | Auto % | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ |
| First-week Feedback Rate | 75% | Auto % | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ |
| Time-to-First-Post (\<48h goal) | TRUE % | Auto % | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ |
| Mentorship Assignments in 72h | 100% | Auto % | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ |
| Staff Suggestions Implemented % | \[Goal\] | Manual | TBD |

---

### **📈 AUTO-CALCULATIONS**

Set up calculated columns to do the following:

* `Checklist Completion Rate` \= Avg of checklist % from `Member Data`

* `First-week Feedback Rate` \= Count of "Feedback Submitted \= ✅" / Total members

---

### **🎨 VISUALIZATION**

Use:

* **Progress Bars** for % goals

* **Emoji Indicators**:

  * ✅ \= On target

  * ⚠️ \= Needs attention

  * ❌ \= Behind

* **Conditional Formatting**:

  * Green \= Above Goal

  * Yellow \= Near Goal

  * Red \= Failing harder than your high school crush's mixtape career

---

### **🧨 BONUS FLAIR**

* Embed GIF reactions for milestones (e.g. “🎉 First post in \<48h\! Welcome aboard\!”)

* Add a filter for “Stuck Users” \= Checklist \< 50% AND No Engagement

* Leaderboard for most engaging mentors (yes, competitive chaos mode ON)

---

---

## **🧠 DO THIS FIRST: Gamified Trello Flow**

Why? Because it locks in behavior, habit, and checklist dopamine fast. That onboarding flow needs to run like it’s on rails with glitter and threats.

### **🔥 Trello Automation Templates:**

**Columns:**

* 🧠 Welcome Brain Dump

* ✅ First 24h Wins

* 🎯 72h Missions

* 🌈 Identity Challenges

* 🔁 Ongoing XP

**Card Examples:**

* ✅ Post your intro in Slack (w/ button to Slack)

* 🧪 Try “Icebreaker Roulette”

* 📸 Drop your Identity Card (link Canva)

* 🧠 DM your mentor \+ screenshot it

* 💬 React in 3 threads

**Automation:**

* Card moves to ✅ when checklist completed

* When all 72h cards done → auto-tag as “Level 2 Initiate”

* Slack bot notification on Level Up (Zapier or Slack workflow)

* Weekly auto-email summary: your XP stats \+ a leaderboard tease

—

## **🎨 THEN: Canva Identity Card Generator**

This one is sexy, high-visibility, but **low retention impact** unless it’s tied into Trello or Slack rewards.

**Why do it second?** Because without the Trello gamification layer, people just post pretty intros once and ghost us harder than your last situationship.

### **What you’ll want:**

* 3–4 Canva templates, editable, drag-drop

* “Post your card” call-to-action in Slack

* Tie submissions to leaderboard or badges (e.g. “Identity Unlocked”)

---

## **TL;DR for your big forehead:**

| Priority | Flow | Outcome | Automation Potential |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| ✅ FIRST | Trello XP Tracker | Checklist Completion \+ Retention | HIGH |
| 🔜 SECOND | Canva Identity Card | Engagement \+ Vibes | MEDIUM |

---

Now lemme know if you want:

* Pre-filled **Trello template board** with automation cheats

* Canva card generator embedded in onboarding email

* Slack leaderboard hack to auto-show “Level Ups”

Choose your chaos, Professor Spreadsheet 🧠💅

---

### **✍️ Feedback on Your Edits:**

#### **✅ Tone:**

Dead-on. That **"you got this, but also here’s a glitter flamethrower in case you need it"** tone is just chef's kiss. Friendly? ✅ Motivating? ✅ Slightly unhinged? ✅✅✅  
 You’re hitting that sweet spot between “competent cult leader” and “your cool older cousin who got out of a pyramid scheme.”

#### **✅ Clarity & Flow:**

Your bullet flow is so smooth it makes butter look clumsy. Everything reads clearly and in a digestible rhythm. I can actually picture the flow of new members getting absorbed into the system like it’s a Pixar onboarding montage.

---

### **🤏 BUTTTTT (yes, there's always a butt):**

#### **🧠 *“Powerful Intro Frameworks” Section:***

You *nailed* the vibe, but it’s a **little buried** at the bottom. That section is pure GOLD for driving engagement—it deserves to be teased earlier. Maybe in the **“First 72 Hours”** section as a mention? Like:

“Prompt them with a 3-Layer Cake or Roulette post (see Personality Frameworks below)”

Make them drool early, you know? 👀

---

#### **🧪 *Experiments Section:***

You're asking all the right questions—but what about a hint at **where** experiments get logged? Is it in Trello? Coda? Your brain’s fourth dimension? Drop a link, a tag, or at least make a cheeky comment like:

“See: Lab Rats Log in Coda for live experiments”

---

#### **🪄 *Gamification Mentions:***

You're close to ✨legendary tier✨ but wanna go full Pokémon-evolution? Connect the **light challenges** from onboarding with the **XP/badge ideas** from growth hacks. Maybe suggest a challenge in week 1 → earns badge → shows up on Coda profile. Boom, instant dopamine loop.

---

### **👀 Minor Thingy:**

“Mid-season feedback summary delivered” (under Mentors)

❓ What is mid-season? Is this a game show? A romcom arc? Just clarify it’s like... bi-monthly or at the end of X week cycle or whatnot. Nerds like me wanna timeline that sucker.

---

### **🏁 TL;DR for You, Queen of Organized Chaos™:**

* 🔥 Tease the 3-Layer Cake \+ Roulette stuff earlier\!

* 🧪 Drop a link or name for the experiment tracker

* 🎮 Tie badges ↔️ mini-challenges \= serotonin bomb

* ⏰ Define “mid-season” or prepare to be asked by a Slack gremlin

---

### **🪄 Re-Engagement Playbook: "Return of the Ghosts"**

For: Ghosted Members (aka Slack phantoms)  
 Role: Community Necromancer™  
 Mission: Resurrect engagement without sounding desperate (you already are)

---

## **🕵️ Step 1: Identify the Ghosts**

* Criteria:

  * No Slack activity in 7+ days

  * Checklist under 50%

  * No response to mentor ping

* Tag in Coda as: `🫥 Ghost Pending`

* Auto-label in Trello: `👻 Needs Wake-Up Call`

---

## **📬 Step 2: Re-Engagement Campaign (Multi-Touch)**

### **🔹 Day 1 — Soft Ping (Slack DM or Email)**

**Subject/Message:** "We miss your chaotic genius 🫠"  
 *“Hey \[Name\], we noticed you haven’t stirred the Slack cauldron in a bit. If life’s wild, no sweat – just wanted to say your voice matters here (even if it’s just memes).”*

* Include 1-click shortcut: "Reactivate Checklist" / "Share a Win" / "Say Hi in \#random"

### **🔹 Day 3 — Meme Attack**

Drop a "we miss you" meme or gif in DM.  
 Bonus: Use their intro post material (if any) to personalize the roast.

### **🔹 Day 5 — Public Nudge (if appropriate)**

* Feature them in “Member We Love” roundup or shoutout old intro.

* Use humor:

*“Still wondering what happened to \[Name\]’s Notion addiction. Blink twice if alive.”*

### **🔹 Day 7 — FOMO Bomb**

Invite to exclusive event or mini-challenge.  
 *“Secret challenge alert: only 5 invites, and you’re on the list. Let’s see what your ghost powers can do 🧙‍♀️”*

---

## **⚙️ Automation Layer**

* **Ghost Tracker View** in Coda (Last activity \+ Checklist %)

* Zapier Trigger:

  * If "No activity in 7d" → Slack DM

  * If "No checklist progress in 5d" → Email Reminder

* Trello Automation:

  * Label "👻 Needs Wake-Up Call" triggers card comment from mentor

---

## **🎯 Goals & KPIs**

| Metric | Goal |
| ----- | ----- |
| Re-engagement Response Rate | 50% |
| Ghost-to-Checklist Conversion | 30% |
| Post-Reactivation Slack Action | 1+ action |
| Member Sentiment (qualitative) | 1 comment per 5 ghosts |

2. Use this outline, set up tables for each step, and then **link** those to automations in Slack or email (you know, Zapier, baby).

3. **Add buttons** for tasks like “Post Intro in Slack” to auto-submit tasks for members.

### **Step 1: Stop Copying Everyone Else**

Yeah, you heard me. Stop watching *those* influencers who tell you they’ve figured it out. Stop mimicking every popular trend because you *think* it’ll make you cooler. You're not a puppet, even if you sometimes *feel* like it.

### **Step 2: Take a Look at Yourself (For Real)**

I know, it’s hard to even look at yourself with all the cringey stuff you’ve done, but **look inside**. What makes you laugh? What *annoys* you? What pisses you off so much you can’t shut up about it? You’re a walking *reaction machine*, so just start from there. Your voice is a mix of your values, quirks, pet peeves, and what you care about.

### **Step 3: Be Unapologetically You**

Yeah, I’m gonna hit you with this one: Don’t *sugarcoat* it. No one cares if you're "trying to be nice" all the time. You’re not a doormat, and you’re certainly not “just trying to fit in.” If your thoughts are loud, let them be loud. If they’re sarcastic or sassy, let them fly. Don’t mute your inner voice just to fit the mold, because guess what? Everyone else already does that and it’s boring.

### **Step 4: Use Humor as Your Weapon**

What’s better than sarcasm? Nothing. Get used to it. Every time you drop a line, make it count. Use irony. Use exaggeration. Be dramatic. Get *real* comfortable with being misunderstood and “*cringe*.” It’s fun. You'll find that when you don't try too hard, you get more of that raw, authentic sound.

### **Step 5: Stop Giving a Damn About Approval**

Listen up—everyone's got something to say, but not everyone’s gonna *like* it. If you wait around for approval, you’ll be stuck forever. *Say it*. Let it *land*. If they laugh, great. If they don’t? Too bad. You don’t need to babysit their feelings.

### **Step 6: Iterate**

You think you've found your voice? Yeah, right. You’ll be changing, tweaking, and *testing* out different tones, styles, and delivery methods for ages. And that's great. Don’t expect to find perfection in the first draft of anything. Your voice will evolve with you.

---

So, when it’s all said and done, your voice is just *you* turned up to 11\. You might feel a little weird at first, but trust me, it’s worth it. Now, do you think you can handle actually using it? Or are you just gonna keep second-guessing everything like usual? 😏

# 

# Clarify Your Brand Personality

### **You’re not some random, “neutral” entity. Your brand has to have character—no, not the boring kind, but the type that stands out, grabs attention, and has *presence*.**

1. ### **Ask yourself:** 

   * ### **What is the vibe of the brand?** 

   * ### **Is it quirky? Professional? Casual? Funny? Serious?** 

   * ### **Is your community fun, supportive, edgy, or rebellious?** 

### **Think of it like creating a character. If your brand were a person, how would they dress, talk, and act? Write down those adjectives.**

### ---

### **Step 2: Define Your Community Tone**

### **Your community is like your loyal army. They follow, they engage, and if you do it right, they defend you like you're their best friend. You need to talk to them like you know them and understand them.**

1. ### **Questions to ask yourself:** 

   * ### **Do they want to be part of a cool club, or do they need a safe space to connect and vent?** 

   * ### **Do they like straightforwardness, or do they prefer a bit of humor and sass in the mix?** 

   * ### **How do they interact with each other? Do they post memes? Are they super supportive? Do they joke around?** 

### **Your community tone should mirror their behavior while amplifying it. You're creating a vibe, so don't be too formal unless that's your style.**

### ---

### **Step 3: Consistency is Key**

### **Now, let’s get real for a second: You can’t just be all over the place with your voice. One minute you're funny, the next minute you're serious? That's going to confuse everyone. You need consistency in how you talk, respond, and present your brand.**

1. ### **Create a voice guide that covers:** 

   * ### **Language style: Casual, professional, slang-heavy, or polished?** 

   * ### **Tone: Friendly, sassy, empowering, educational, or funny?** 

   * ### **Topics to avoid: What will *not* be tolerated or should be avoided?** 

   * ### **Personality traits: Smart, bold, witty, supportive, tough love?** 

### **Be sure you know exactly how to represent the brand every time. It’s like a script. Not *too* rigid, but enough to be recognizable.**

### ---

### **Step 4: Engage with the Community Like a Real Human**

### **You’re their leader, so if you're acting all robotic and distant, they’ll sniff it out.**

* ### **Be conversational. No one likes a brand that speaks like a bot.** 

* ### **Ask questions. Encourage feedback and make it feel like a conversation.** 

* ### **Use humor (if that fits your vibe). Get in the game. Don’t be afraid to *poke fun* or tease your audience.** 

* ### **React in real-time. That’s why your community needs to feel *alive*. Be there when something happens, and always give them something to respond to.** 

### ---

### **Step 5: Test, Learn, Adjust**

### **If you’re not testing your voice, you’re just guessing. You need to see what works for your community and what doesn’t. Just like a comedian tests jokes on an audience, you’ve got to figure out what hits and what falls flat.**

* ### **Look at engagement metrics: Which posts, comments, and responses are generating the most interaction?** 

* ### **Experiment: Try different tones and styles. One post might be super edgy, while another is super positive. Find what works and adjust.** 

* ### **Ask your community: Seriously, what’s better than feedback from the people you're *trying* to impress? They’ll tell you if you’re killing it or if you sound like an awkward robot.** 

### ---

### **Step 6: Stay True to Your Core Values**

### **Lastly, don’t get caught up in trying to please everyone. Yeah, you’ll make some people mad, but you can’t please everyone. Stick to what your brand stands for and stay true to that.**

* ### **What’s the mission of your brand?** 

* ### **What kind of people do you want in your community?** 

* ### **What do you want to inspire or make people feel?** 

### **Let these values guide your voice and make sure everything aligns. Don't just make noise for the sake of it. Your voice needs to serve your community's needs, not just throw out random words.**

### ---

### **In a Nutshell**

* ### **Brand Personality: Know who your brand is. What adjectives describe it?** 

* ### **Community Tone: Reflect the vibe of the people you want to engage with.** 

* ### **Consistency: Stick to a voice guide.** 

* ### **Human Interaction: Speak directly with people, no stiff corporate nonsense.** 

* ### **Test and Learn: See what works and adjust.** 

* ### **Core Values: Don't forget what your brand stands for.** 

### ---

### 

### 

### **Framework for Finding Your Brand & Community Voice**

---

### **\*\*Step 1: Audience Breakdown**

Before you even think about your voice, you *need* to know who you're talking to. Because if you talk to everyone, you're going to talk to no one.

#### **Questions to ask:**

* **Who is your community?**

  * Age, interests, lifestyle, location?

  * What do they **value** the most?

  * How do they talk to each other? Are they jokers? Do they keep it chill? Are they more serious?

* **What problems are they facing?**

  * **Emotional** problems (stress, anxiety, confusion)?

  * **Practical** problems (struggling with certain tools, looking for help, etc.)?

The more specific you get here, the better you’ll define your voice. Remember: You’re not just talking to an abstract "audience"—you’re speaking to *real* people.

---

### **Step 2: Brand Purpose \+ Personality**

Now that you know who you're talking to, let’s get into what *your brand* actually is. What makes you stand out from the sea of endless wannabes?

#### **Questions to ask:**

* **Why does your brand exist?**

  * What’s your **mission**? (Purpose, goal, big picture)

  * Why would people **care** about your brand in the first place?

* **What personality would your brand have if it were a person?**

  * Think: Sarcastic? Professional? Funny? Snarky? Witty? Empowering? Friendly?

  * **Write down** adjectives that best describe your brand’s personality. Try 5–10 at first.

---

### **Step 3: Voice Tone Experimentation (First Round)**

Here’s the fun part: You get to try on different voices\! Don’t worry, we’re not gonna sit around waiting for divine inspiration. We’re going to **test** it out and see what feels right.

#### **Questions to ask:**

* **How do you want to come across?**

  * Do you want to be the friend that always brings humor or the leader that’s motivating?

  * Do you want to come off as **authoritative**, **relatable**, or **playful**?

#### **Try different "tones" and experiment with:**

* **Formal tone** – Friendly, but a bit more polished.

* **Casual tone** – Super chill, like texting your best friend.

* **Humorous tone** – Add snark, sarcasm, and wit. Think: funny memes and jokes.

* **Empathetic tone** – Super supportive and validating.

Experiment with these tones in your posts and responses, and see how your audience reacts.

---

### **Step 4: Engagement Style**

This is **critical**, and you’ve gotta figure this out fast: *How* are you going to talk to people directly? Are you going to lead discussions? React to posts with humor? Or make it feel like a tight-knit family?

#### **Questions to ask:**

* **What kind of communication do you want?**

  * Are you more **active** (leading discussions, responding quickly), or more **reactive** (waiting for comments and jumping in)?

  * What will your **community interactions** be like? Will you respond with humor, advice, or even challenge people?

#### **Try:**

* **Open-ended questions** – “What do you think about this?” or “How does this resonate with you?”

* **Reacting to comments** – Be funny, direct, or even sarcastic if it fits.

* **Active participation** – Post polls, quizzes, memes, or challenges to engage people.

It’s all about finding what makes people **interact** with your content.

---

### **Step 5: Messaging Guidelines & Filter**

Now that you’re starting to get a feel for things, you **need** to keep everything consistent. If you don’t have any guidelines, things will go off the rails fast.

#### **Build your voice guide (a mini cheat sheet for consistency):**

* **What do you always do?**

  * Are you super *formal*? Do you always use **humor** in responses? What’s your default tone?

* **What do you never do?**

  * Are there words or attitudes you won’t use? (E.g., nothing “too harsh” or “too professional”)

* **What about certain topics?**

  * What’s your **no-go zone**? If someone makes a rude comment, are you quick to put them in their place, or do you gently redirect?

Write this out and keep it visible—this will be your brand’s **voice bible**.

---

### **Step 6: Continuous Testing \+ Feedback Loop**

Now, you can’t just stop here. Your voice is a living, breathing thing. It needs constant testing, tweaking, and feedback. If you stop, it’ll get stale and boring. **No one wants that**.

#### **Questions to ask:**

* **What’s working?**

  * Look at engagement rates. What kinds of posts get the most comments, likes, shares, etc.?

* **What isn’t working?**

  * Are some responses falling flat? Is there a particular style that’s **not resonating**?

#### **Action Plan:**

* **Adjust your tone**: If something didn’t hit, change it up. Maybe you need to be a little more or less casual.

* **Refine your community interaction**: Maybe you need to engage a bit more or make your posts more **visually appealing**.

Repeat this testing phase every few weeks. You’ll never “settle” on one voice; it’ll evolve with your community.

---

### **Framework for Attracting Mentor Personas with Your Brand & Community Voice**

---

### **Step 1: Understand Mentor Needs & Desires (The Real Talk)**

Mentors are **busy**. They’re usually established, sought-after, and possibly tired of answering the same dumb questions. You’re not just attracting anyone—you’re attracting **valuable, experienced mentors** who want to engage with a *community* that’s going places.

#### **Questions to Ask:**

* **What do mentors want?**

  * They’re after **meaningful conversations** and **growth opportunities**, not just “likes” and “thumbs up.”

  * They want to engage with **purpose-driven individuals** and communities. If they see potential and ambition in your brand, you’ll stand out.

* **What problems are you solving for them?**

  * Maybe they want to pass on their knowledge and skills to the next generation, but only if they see the **passion and initiative** in the people they engage with.

  * Are you providing them with **valuable content** that helps them stay at the top of their game? Are you offering **insightful discussions** that challenge their knowledge?

Focus on **empowerment, growth, and challenge**. This is what mentors thrive on.

---

### **Step 2: Define Your Brand’s Purpose as a Magnet for Mentors**

Mentors will flock to brands that align with their **personal values** and **growth-oriented missions**. Don’t just talk about how awesome you are—*prove it* with a laser-focused brand purpose that speaks to mentors’ ambitions and professional goals.

#### **Key Considerations:**

* **Mentor-Focused Purpose**: What is your community’s **bigger mission** that resonates with **leaders and mentors**? Do you focus on **leadership development**, **life-changing advice**, or **personal growth**?

  * Example: "We help passionate professionals who want to become better leaders by connecting with people who have been there and done that."

* **Mentor Alignment**: Are you in a space that **mentors respect**? Think: education, entrepreneurship, leadership, development. The more **relevant** your brand’s mission is to the mentor’s field of expertise, the more likely you’ll attract their attention.

---

### **Step 3: Craft a Voice that Appeals to Mentors—Professional Yet Relatable**

Mentors want to feel like they’re engaging with a brand that **values** their time and wisdom. They want to be respected, **but they also want authenticity**. Your community’s voice needs to balance professionalism with **relatability**.

#### **Voice Characteristics to Adopt:**

* **Professional, but not stuffy**: Mentors don’t want to feel like they’re being lectured or talked down to. Keep it **authentic** and **respectful** but still **approachable**.

* **Challenge and Inspire**: Don’t just praise the mentor’s advice—actively **ask for** it and **value their experience**. Engage them with **questions** that show you’re open to learning and growing.

  * Example: “We’re curious, @mentor\_name—how would you approach this challenge?” Or, “Your thoughts on this, @mentor\_name, are worth a million to us. What’s your take?”

* **Supportive**: Always support their contributions and frame the community as a **collaborative space**. Make them feel like a **key player**, not just a **resource**.

---

### **Step 4: Create Conversations that Attract Mentors**

Mentors want to engage, but they don’t want to waste time in **shallow interactions**. Your discussions need to be **high-caliber**, interesting, and **stimulating**—no fluff. Show them you’re worth their time.

#### **What Should You Discuss?**

* **Advanced Topics**: Mentors love to talk about what they’ve learned over the years. Craft conversations around **real-world challenges**, **strategies**, and **life lessons**.

  * Example: "What’s the biggest lesson you’ve learned in your career that most people overlook?”

* **Open-Ended Challenges**: Don’t be afraid to **ask them to share wisdom**. Use **thought-provoking** questions that require deep reflection.

  * Example: “In your opinion, what’s the best way to prepare for failure, and how can young professionals bounce back from it?”

* **Ask for Mentorship**: Yes, straight-up ask for it, but with **respect**. Frame it as an opportunity for them to pass on their knowledge to people who value it.

  * Example: “We’d be honored if you could share your perspective on \[topic\]. What advice would you give someone starting out?”

---

### **Step 5: Content That Resonates with Mentors**

Your **content** isn’t just for engagement—it’s a powerful tool to **attract** mentors. You need to create content that speaks to their **interests**, **values**, and **expertise**.

#### **Content Ideas:**

* **Mentor Spotlights**: Feature mentors in the community. Ask for their advice and insights. This **highlights** their expertise and gives them the chance to **showcase their value**.

  * Example: "We were lucky enough to chat with @mentor\_name about how they navigated the toughest challenges in their career. Here’s their incredible advice."

* **Thought Leadership Articles**: Post deep dives into areas where mentors can contribute their knowledge and experience. Ask them for their **opinion** on a trending issue.

  * Example: “We’re discussing the future of leadership development. Here’s where we think it’s headed. What are your thoughts on this, @mentor\_name?”

* **Q\&A Sessions with Mentors**: Host Q\&A sessions where mentors can answer the community's burning questions. This gives them **visibility** and positions them as a **trusted expert**.

---

### **Step 6: Make Engagement Effortless and Rewarding**

Mentors are busy, so don’t expect them to just pop in for a chat without a **reward**. If you want to keep them engaged, you need to create **systems** that respect their time while still offering value.

#### **Ways to Engage:**

* **Mentor-Exclusive Spaces**: Create a **special section** in your community where mentors can discuss ideas, share resources, or just network. Make this space a **valuable reward** for their time.

* **Recognition**: Publicly recognize **mentors' contributions**. Give them **credits** for sharing their expertise, whether through shout-outs or featuring them in newsletters.

* **Collaborative Content Creation**: Don’t just ask them for advice—ask them to **collaborate** on content like blog posts, videos, or webinars. This lets them contribute at a higher level, and they’ll feel more involved.

---

### **Step 7: Keep Iterating and Refining**

Finally, mentors aren’t going to stick around for the long term if they don’t feel their contributions are valued. You’ve got to **refine** your approach continuously based on their feedback.

#### **What to Track:**

* **Engagement Levels**: Are mentors actively engaging in discussions? Are they contributing ideas, or do they just pop in and leave?

* **Content Performance**: Are the posts where you tag mentors getting more attention? Do their responses lead to deeper discussions in the community?

* **Feedback**: Ask mentors for feedback. Be open to their suggestions for how the community can improve.

---

### **In Conclusion:**

To attract **mentor personas**, you need to:

1. **Understand their motivations** (value growth, meaningful interactions, leadership).

2. Create a **professional yet approachable voice**.

3. Foster **high-level discussions** that challenge and inspire.

4. Produce **content** that resonates with their expertise and allows them to shine.

5. **Respect their time** by offering meaningful recognition and opportunities for engagement.

**Bonus Tip**: Make sure you're consistent\! Mentors are busy and will bounce if they don’t see **continuous** high-quality interactions. Keep the quality up, and they’ll come back for more.

Now, go get yourself a mentor, and stop wasting my time. 😏

---

### **1\. Value Growth**

Mentors want to feel like they're **growing** personally and **professionally**. It’s not just about *passing on knowledge*—it's about **being part of something bigger**, something that challenges them and makes them rethink their own strategies.

#### **Why Does This Matter?**

* **Growth \= Relevance**: Mentors want to stay relevant. They’re constantly looking for new ways to improve their skills, perspectives, and understanding of their industry.

* **Legacy and Impact**: They want to leave a **lasting legacy**, which is why they seek **value growth**—not just in themselves but in the people they mentor too. Helping others grow reflects back on their ability to grow.

### **How to Tap Into This?**

* **Provide Learning Opportunities**: Create spaces in your community where mentors can also be **challenged**. Give them **advanced discussions** or **new perspectives** they might not have thought about. This way, they get to engage in their own **growth** while helping others grow.

* **Content That Pushes Boundaries**: Share thought-provoking content that challenges their current thinking. For example, ask them to tackle “What’s the one thing that’s changed your perspective in the last year?” or "What’s the most underrated trait of effective leadership?"

---

### **2\. Meaningful Interactions**

Mentors don’t want to be **background noise** or just **answers on demand**. They want **authentic conversations** with people who value them—not just **followers**, but people who are genuinely interested in **what they have to offer**.

#### **Why Does This Matter?**

* **Impact Over Quantity**: A mentor wants fewer but **higher quality** interactions that feel **purposeful**. They want to see the fruits of their labor in the form of **real growth**, not just surface-level exchanges.

* **Recognition**: They want to know they’re making a **difference**. Meaningful interactions show them that their time and advice are being **valued** and **used**.

### **How to Tap Into This?**

* **Ask Deep Questions**: Engage them with questions that require thoughtful, reflective answers. Don’t settle for “What’s your advice for this?” Instead, go for “What’s the toughest challenge you faced early in your career, and how did you overcome it?”

* **Real Conversations, Not Just Soundbites**: Instead of treating mentors like **answer machines**, engage them in **conversations** that reflect the **depth** of their experience. Get into a back-and-forth dialogue where you can learn from them **and** they can learn from others.

---

### **3\. Leadership**

Mentors are, by nature, **leaders**. They’ve got the experience, they’ve earned the trust, and they’ve faced their own challenges. Their role isn’t just to give advice, but to **inspire**, **empower**, and **guide** others toward becoming **better leaders** themselves.

#### **Why Does This Matter?**

* **The Power of Influence**: They’re not just teaching—they’re shaping the future. They want to **empower others** to lead in their own right, ensuring that the next generation has the tools and **skills** to take the torch.

* **Self-Reflection and Accountability**: By mentoring, they’re **reinforcing their own leadership**. They’re constantly learning what makes others tick, which challenges their own views and hones their leadership.

### **How to Tap Into This?**

* **Encourage Leadership Development**: Your community should emphasize **leadership skills**. Create content or spaces for discussions around **leadership** and **team-building**, and ask your mentors to lead those conversations.

* **Mentorship as a Two-Way Street**: Allow mentors to feel like they’re **developing** as much as the people they mentor. Show them how their leadership **grows** as they teach others. When they feel like they’re **improving** as leaders, they’re more likely to stay engaged and invest their time.

---

### **In Summary, Here’s What You Need to Know:**

1. **Value Growth**: Mentors are looking for **personal and professional growth**—they want to feel like they’re **constantly evolving** and their time is spent on people who are serious about growth.

2. **Meaningful Interactions**: They crave **authentic, high-quality interactions**. It's not about quantity—it’s about leaving a **lasting impact** on people who appreciate their guidance.

3. **Leadership**: Mentors are **natural leaders**, and they want to be **empowered** and respected. They’re interested in **inspiring** others to be leaders as well.

---

### **🎯 Key Voice Tweaks to Apply Throughout**

1. **Professional**

   * Clear, concise language with structured headers and bullet points.

   * Use active voice and action-oriented phrasing.

   * Tone is confident but not overhyped.

2. **Approachable**

   * Keep the fun elements (like emojis and playful headers), but balance them with clarity and purpose.

   * Soften aggressive humor—keep it quirky and upbeat instead of snarky or chaotic.

   * Use friendly, inclusive language like “you’ll find,” “we recommend,” “feel free to.”

---

### **🔧 Example Refinement**

#### **Original:**

Why? Because it locks in behavior, habit, and checklist dopamine fast. That onboarding flow needs to run like it’s on rails with glitter and threats.

#### **Refined:**

Why? Because it builds momentum, habits, and early wins. Think of it as an onboarding flow on rails—with a little sparkle and a lot of structure.

---

#### **Original:**

Ensure checklist progress: 50% completion target  
 Add to "Who's New" Coda view or Slack thread  
 Assign light engagement challenge: post or comment in \#random or \#your-journey

#### **Refined:**

* Target 50% checklist completion within the first 72 hours

* Highlight the member in the “Who’s New” section on Coda or Slack

* Invite them to join a light engagement challenge (e.g. post in \#random or \#your-journey)

---

If you’d like, I can go through the whole document and rewrite the tone consistently to hit this balance of pro \+ approachable. Want me to start with a specific section or the whole thing? 😏

## **🧠🔥 Level-Up Discussions: Thought Leader Sparks**

For the bold brains who joined to *build* something — not just vibe in the corner.

### **🎯 Goals:**

* Surface ambitious ideas early

* Create space for constructive friction

* Empower new members to contribute meaningfully, fast

### **🔥 Implementation Plan:**

1. **Weekly Power Prompt (Slack Thread or Coda Embed)**  
    Drop a high-voltage question like:

   * *“What’s one sacred PM ritual you think is actually BS — and why?”*

   * *“If you had unlimited budget and zero stakeholders, what community experiment would you launch tomorrow?”*

   * *“What’s one ‘unpopular truth’ about leadership that you’ve learned the hard way?”*

2. **Curated Micro-Forums (Opt-In)**  
    Auto-tag newcomers by interest (via onboarding form or intro post) and invite them to:

   * **Mini-Think Tanks** (small group DM or private thread): Rotate topics weekly

   * **Lightning Rants Sessions** (15-min calls): Everyone gets 3 minutes to provoke the room

---

Wanna add this to the doc? Want me to rewrite it in your tone, sprinkle more glitter, or turn it into a systemized block like the others? Or are you scared the discussion's gonna be too advanced for your soft lil brain to handle, hmm? 😏

### **✅ ADD: “Shine Zone” Section (New Members’ Brag Board)**

#### **💡 Why?**

Turn the spotlight on them early. Recognition creates retention. It also filters high-signal talent straight into the core community radar.

#### **✨ Section Title: “Brag Bites: Show Off Your Spark”**

Add to Stage 3 or Bonus section.

**Instructions for new members:**

"Drop 1 screenshot, link, or voice memo that shows off something you’re proud of—big or small. Did you run a killer retro? Build an internal tool? Invent a Slack emoji taxonomy? THIS IS YOUR MOMENT."

Then add a running thread or Coda view with:

* 🧠 Name

* 🏆 Brag Bite

* 💬 Peer Shoutouts

* 🌟 Tag: Skill or Theme (“Product Ops,” “Meeting Magic,” “Unicorn PM”)

---

### **🔁 ADJUST: Feedback Form Prompts to Let Them Flex**

**Current Goal:** Get 1 qualitative feedback point per new member.

**Update the form to include “Let Us Brag About You” prompts:**

* “What’s something weirdly specific you’re amazing at?”

* “What should people come to you for?”

* “What’s one challenge you’ve crushed that others might struggle with?”

Then you can:

* Surface this in onboarding highlights

* Auto-mention them in relevant future convos (via Slack bots or Coda triggers)

---

### **📣 INSERT: “Mentor Spotlight Moments” in Slack**

Encourage mentors to post short “Mentor Spotlights” where they praise something *specific* about their mentee publicly after 72h.

Example format:

🔦 **Mentor Spotlight: \[@Name\]** This week’s dopamine injection: \[Thing they did\]. 🔥 You better keep an eye on this one. 💡

ts.

---

## **💥 Силни страни (и не, не говорим за трицепсите ти от copy-pasting)**

### **1\. Ясен, структуриран, визуално приятен формат.**

Сериозно, ако това беше конкурс за най-много bullet points, щеше да вземеш злато и да си направиш трофей с Notion лого.

### **2\. Глас и тон:**

Браво, Nerdzilla. Имаш one consistent voice — хем забавен, хем целенасочен. Пак си въвела тази полу-саркастична, meme-friendly стилистика, която действа като антидот на скучните onboarding гайдове.

### **3\. Епичен use на gamification:**

Level Up системата в Trello, XP статистики, мини-челинджи... буквално се усеща като onboarding RPG. Готино, ако не броим факта, че хората ще се чувстват виновни, ако не направят интро поста си като haiku в рима.

---

## **🧨 Облаци на хоризонта (a.k.a. къде започва срама):**

### **1\. Прекалено дълго за реалния attention span на новите.**

Говорим си за хора, които имат 13 отворени таба и Slack ping-ове на всеки 6 секунди. Това не е „Onboarding Kit“, това е **Community Bible 3.0**.

❗ Suggestion: Раздели го на bite-sized versions — „Starter Pack“, „Next Level“, „Mentor Guide“, etc.

### **2\. Къде е "Why Should I Care"?**

Сякаш липсва мотивационен луп — какво ще спечели потребителят, ако изкара onboarding-а като champion?

❗ Suggestion: Добави секция „What's in it for you?“ – хората искат слава, връзки, и... Slack emoji реакции. Направи го ясно.

### **3\. Вътрешният Markdown meeting brief... сух.**

Между меметата и Icebreaker Roulette, това звучи като Notion документ, който някой е кръстил „Final-Final-2-LAST-update-v7.md“.

❗ Suggestion: Или го вкарай в същия tone-of-voice (с леки roast-ове и flair), или го изнеси в отделен boring-but-useful internal doc.

---

## **🧠 UX Nerd Feedback (за Queen Miss Brainiac™):**

* Имаш 234783 идеи, но трябва малко **flow control** – къде започва човек, къде свършва, и какво следва нататък?

* Някои секции могат да са collapsible или под формата на tabs / toggles, ако го качиш в Coda/Notion.

* Trello \+ Slack \+ Coda \= 🧩⚠️ Context switching hell.

   Може ли да има one-pager или Command Center, който агрегира важните действия?

  ---

  ## **😈 За финал – Roast Section™:**

* “Welcome Brain Dump”? Това име звучи като community onboarding след хранително натравяне.

* „Gamified flow с glitter and threats“? Явно ти е останал PTSD от корпоративен onboarding с PowerPoint от 2009\.

* „Find your PM twin\!“ – чудесна идея, ако искаш хората да rage quit още първата седмица, щото нямат съвпадение.

* “Share a haiku”? Бе, ти хора ли онбордваш или ги караш да кандидатстват в Hogwarts?


---
