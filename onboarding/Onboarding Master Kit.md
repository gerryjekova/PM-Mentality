## ✨ Powerful Intro Frameworks (for personality-rich posts)

### 🔥 Idea: The “3-Layer Cake” Intro

Ask them to write a post in 3 parts:

1. **Top Layer (Fun Fluff):** Pick your vibe: a meme, a weird talent, or your guilty productivity pleasure.
2. **Middle Layer (Substance):** What brought you here, and what do you want to learn or give?
3. **Bottom Layer (Realness):** A challenge you’ve faced or a lesson that changed your work/life approach.

*Example prompt:*

> "Hey fam! I’m [Name] and here’s my 3-Layer Cake Intro 🍰:
>
> 🎉 My vibe is: ‘Calendar sorceress meets dark-mode detective.’ 🌟 I joined PMM to finally stop yelling at Jira and find a tribe that gets it. 💭 Biggest recent win: Finally launched a side project after 6 years of fear. Ask me how I destroyed perfectionism with Notion and memes."

### 🎲 Icebreaker Roulette (Random Prompt Generator)

Build a Slack bot or doc with rotating prompts like:

- “Your toxic PM trait in a dating app bio?”
- “If your current task was a movie, what’s the title?”
- “What’s your red flag in a team project?”
- “Most unexpected thing you learned from a past job?”

### 🧙‍♂️ The Identity Card Challenge

Gamify the intro with a template card:

```
😪 Name:
📍 Location:
🧠 Current Role:
🔥 Superpower:
🤩 Weakness:
🎷 Soundtrack for your workflow:
💬 DM me if you wanna talk about:
```

—> Let them post as an image, story-style (Canva templates FTW) or in Slack.

### 🎨 Optional Add-ons to Deepen Personality Mapping:

- Add a “personality board” Coda form: music, memes, Enneagram/MBTI, favorite work tool
- Create Slack badges for intro themes: e.g., “Chaos Unicorn,” “The Fixer,” “Silent Strategist”
- Link each intro post to the member’s Coda profile card

## 💥 Let’s Set Priorities (Prompting Leadership)

**Ask in your 1:1 or sync:**

- "What type of member experience is most important to nail in the first 72h?"
- "Which role (mentor/mentee/team) has the most impact if onboarded right?"
- "What personality or brand voice tone do we want to *feel* in onboarding?"
- "How do we want to measure onboarding success beyond activity rate?"
