YABAA, look who’s finally ready to **combine trackers like a productivity Power Ranger** 💅

Alright, Nerdzilla, here’s how you’re gonna build that **Gamified Onboarding Tracker in Coda** like the spreadsheet sorceress you pretend to be. This tracker will consolidate onboarding status, engagement actions, and feedback into a single juicy workflow. Let’s go, Big Brain:

---

## 🧃 Coda Gamified Onboarding Tracker (Workflow Overview)

### 🎛️ Main Table: `Onboarding Master Tracker`

**Columns:**
- `Name`
- `Join Date`
- `Role (Mentor/Mentee/Team)`
- `Checklist Completion %`
- `First Post Date`
- `Engagement Type` (Multiselect: Slack, Event, Poll, DM)
- `Qualitative Feedback` (Free Text)
- `XP Points` (Formula-driven 👇)
- `Status` (Auto-tag: In Progress / Completed / Ghosting 💀)
- `Mentor Assigned` (Lookup)
- `Slack Tag Status` (✅/❌)
- `Coda Access?` (✅/❌)

### 🧠 XP SYSTEM (Because you're clearly addicted to fake internet points)

```formula
XP Points = 
If([Checklist Completion %] = 100, 50, 0) +
If([First Post Date].IsNotBlank(), 20, 0) +
If([Engagement Type].Count() >= 2, 30, 0) +
If([Qualitative Feedback].IsNotBlank(), 20, 0)
```

> Show it in a sparkline bar or emoji leaderboard. Because aesthetics, duh.

---

### 📊 View 1: `🔥 Leaderboard View`
Filter: `Status ≠ Ghosting 💀`
Sort by: `XP Points` DESC

Add: Progress bar, fun badge like:
- 🥇 XP God
- 🐣 Just Hatched
- 👻 Missing in Action

---

### 📅 View 2: `⏳ Overdue Onboardings`
Filter:
- `Join Date` is > 72h ago
- `Checklist Completion %` < 90

Use Conditional Format: 🔥 Red background. Because shame is a motivator, right?

---

### 📥 View 3: `Feedback Vault`
Filter: `Qualitative Feedback` is not empty  
Use to auto-generate Slack digest for “What new members are saying”

---

### 🧩 Bonus Automations

- **Slack Welcome Bot** → Adds member to Coda + kicks off row
- **Reminder Button** → Sends gentle nudge like: _“Hey nerd, we see you lurking. Finish onboarding for eternal glory.”_
- **Mentor Assign Button** → Randomly pairs with mentor from dropdown (maybe weighted by current mentees)
- **Email Summary Generator** → Auto-formatted digest every Friday using `_Format()` to pull key stats for your sync doc

---

### 🔄 Optional Integrations (aka "Look how fancy I am")

- 🧠 **AI Column**: Summarize onboarding vibe per person (e.g. “Motivated but confused,” “Ghost-mode,” “Cracked energy.”)
- 🔄 **Sync with Trello**: Checklist synced via automation
- 📩 **Feedback Digest → Notion export or Slack post**

---

Wanna be *extra*, Miss Big Brain? I can help you:

Say the word and I’ll make your workflow prettier than your excuses.  
Chat, what do we think? Is she finally ready or just pretending again? 😏
