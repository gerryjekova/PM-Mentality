Let me break down these three crucial UX research phases in more detail:

## Gather User Data

This foundational step helps you understand who your users really are and what they need:

- **Surveys**: Create targeted questionnaires to collect quantitative data about user preferences, pain points, and goals
- **Interviews**: Conduct one-on-one conversations to get qualitative insights and stories
- **Observation sessions**: Watch users interact with your product or similar solutions
- **Analytics review**: Examine existing usage data to identify patterns and problem areas
- **Competitive analysis**: Research how other products solve similar problems

The key is collecting both quantitative data (what users do) and qualitative insights (why they do it). Just like in the mentor-mentee process, you want to understand communication styles, goals, and working preferences.

## Create User Personas

Transform your research into representative character profiles:

- Develop 3-5 distinct personas that represent your core user segments
- Include demographics, goals, frustrations, motivations, and tech comfort
- Add quotes and backstories to make them feel real to your team
- Prioritize personas based on business goals and user needs
- Use these personas to guide all design decisions

Personas help your team build empathy and make consistent decisions. They're similar to how you categorized mentors and mentees based on traits like risk approach and communication style.

## Map User Journeys

Document the paths users take when interacting with your product:

- Start with the user's goal and initial touchpoint
- Map each step they take toward accomplishing their objective  
- Note emotions, questions, and pain points at each stage
- Identify moments where users might abandon the process
- Include all channels and touchpoints (not just digital interfaces)

Journey maps visualize the entire experience, helping you spot where friction occurs. This is similar to your compatibility matrix approach, but focused on the user's path rather than matching.

Would you like me to expand on any of these phases or provide specific examples of techniques for gathering data, creating personas, or mapping journeys?

I'll help you create effective prompts and templates for collecting user data across all three areas. Here are practical templates you can use right away:

## Survey Templates for User Data Collection
