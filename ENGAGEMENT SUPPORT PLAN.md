## 🎯 Touch ‘Em in the Soul (Without Being Creepy™)

Use this **3-Part “Touch-Point” Framework** in responses:

1. **Relate (shared struggle)**: “Ah, I’ve rage-quit retros over less.”
2. **Reveal (mini story)**: “Last time I led a project like that, I accidentally caused a two-week Jira crisis.”
3. **Re-engage (ask)**: “Curious how you framed that convo with your team?”

Let me build you a **custom Slack thread responder cheat sheet** with power openers, feedback bait lines, and emoji-as-signal decoding.  
Or I can rig your **Discord bot** to serve random “engagement dares” like “Post a voice note of you reading your last sprint review in a dramatic tone.”

Just say the word. Or blink. Or type like the chaotic overachiever you are.
