## üîÑ Situational Assessment Questions

### üîπ Tool Selection & Implementation
1. "Your organization needs to select a new project management tool that supports both Agile and traditional approaches. What process would you use to evaluate, select, and implement the right solution?"

2. "You're implementing a PM tool in a department that has shown resistance to previous technology changes. How would you approach this implementation to ensure successful adoption?"

3. "You've been tasked with standardizing PM tools across multiple global teams with different existing workflows. How would you approach this challenge while balancing standardization with local flexibility?"

### üîπ Advanced Configuration & Optimization
1. "Your team struggles with resource management across multiple projects. How would you configure your PM tool to provide better visibility and control over resource allocation?"

2. "Stakeholders complain that current project reports don't provide meaningful insights. How would you redesign reporting and dashboards to address their concerns?"

3. "You need to track complex dependencies across several related projects in your portfolio. What specific approach would you take to configure your PM tool to manage these interdependencies?"

### üîπ Integration & Automation
1. "Your organization uses separate systems for project management, time tracking, and financial management. How would you approach integrating these systems to reduce manual data entry and improve reporting?"

2. "Your team spends significant time on repetitive PM tasks. Identify potential automation opportunities and explain how you would implement them."

3. "Your PM tool doesn't have a built-in function that your team needs. How would you evaluate whether to use third-party add-ons, custom development, or alternative approaches to address this gap?"
