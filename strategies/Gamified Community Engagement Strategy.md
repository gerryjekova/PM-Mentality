Briefing Document: PM Mentality Community Engagement Strategy & Onboarding
Date: October 26, 2023
Subject: Review of PM Mentality Community Engagement and Onboarding Documentation
Executive Summary:
This brief summarizes key themes and concepts presented in the provided documentation related to the PM Mentality community. The core focus is on developing and implementing a highly structured, gamified, and data-driven approach to community engagement, with a particular emphasis on onboarding new members and cultivating the mentor relationship. The documentation outlines specific goals, KPIs, workflows, tracking methods, and communication strategies, often presented with a distinctively irreverent and energetic tone. Key areas covered include member onboarding, engagement tracking and gamification, feedback collection, mentor management, community health monitoring, and experimentation.
Key Themes & Important Ideas:
1.
Gamified Onboarding & Engagement: A central theme is the heavy reliance on gamification to drive new member behavior and ongoing engagement. This includes XP systems, badges, leaderboards, and micro-challenges integrated across platforms like Coda and Trello. The goal is to leverage "checklist dopamine" and "behavioral momentum" to quickly integrate new members.
◦
XP System: Points are awarded for various actions, including "Intro post (+10 XP)", "Comment in #random or #your-journey (+15 XP)", "DM mentor + screenshot (+20 XP)", "Submit first feedback form (+25 XP)", and "Attend + comment in thread (+25 XP)". Weekly bonuses are also included.
◦
Gamified Trello Flow: Onboarding steps are framed as Trello columns (e.g., "🧠 Welcome Brain Dump", "✅ First 24h Wins", "🎯 72h Missions") with card examples like "✅ Post your intro in Slack (w/ button to Slack)" and "🧪 Try “Icebreaker Roulette”".
◦
Badges & Recognition: Fun badges like "🥇 XP God" and "🐣 Just Hatched" are proposed for the Coda tracker. Trello labels are tied to XP thresholds, triggering Slack bot behaviors and unlocking challenges (e.g., "🔥 "Momentum Mage" | 121–200 XP | Add to shoutout queue; unlock Icebreaker Pro prompt"). "Comeback Kid" and "Ghostbusters Club" badges are suggested for re-engagement. Badges are seen as potentially linkable to mini-challenges for a "serotonin bomb".
◦
Habit Reinforcement: Techniques like "Variable Rewards," "Micro-Challenges," "XP Streak System," and "Public Visibility" of XP stats are suggested to encourage consistent engagement.
2.
Data-Driven Approach with Robust Tracking: The strategy is underpinned by extensive data collection and tracking using tools like Coda, Trello, Google Sheets, and potentially Notion. Metrics and KPIs are defined for various aspects of community health and engagement.
◦
Coda Onboarding Tracker: This is a core tool, suggested to include columns for "Name", "Join Date", "Role", "Checklist Completion %", "First Post Date", "Engagement Type", "Qualitative Feedback", "XP Points", "Status", "Mentor Assigned", "Slack Tag Status", and "Coda Access?". Views can filter for "Ghosting" status or members needing attention.
◦
KPIs Across Responsibility Areas: SMART goals and KPIs are defined for "Community Culture" (e.g., Increase member engagement by 20% over the next quarter, measured by # of active participants per week), "Engagement Experiments" (e.g., Implement 3 new engagement strategies monthly, measured by Participation rates in new initiatives), "Feedback Collection" (e.g., Conduct bi-weekly feedback sessions, measured by Number of actionable insights gathered), "Learning Hub" (e.g., Update 100% of top templates per quarter, measured by Resource usage stats), and "Community Voice" (e.g., Surface 3 blocker themes/month, measured by Slack/Discord threads, insights doc).
◦
Community Health Framework: A comprehensive framework measures "Engagement Vitality", "Community Culture", "Knowledge Exchange", "Member Journey", and "Leadership Health" using specific indicators and thresholds (Warning and Healthy). These metrics feed into a "Community Health Index (CHI)" calculated as a weighted average of dimension scores.
◦
Conditional Formatting: Automated visual cues are recommended for tracking metrics, using conditional formatting in spreadsheets/Coda for green (>=100%), yellow (80-99%), and red (<80%) backgrounds based on target percentages, and arrows for positive/negative trends.
◦
Cohort Analysis: Tracking retention patterns by member join date ("Cohort Analysis") is emphasized as a key method for understanding the member journey.
3.
Structured Onboarding Workflow: A clear, stage-by-stage process is defined for new members, including automated welcome messages, checklist completion prompts, specific early engagement missions, and transition into a "Retention Loop".
◦
Onboarding Goals (SMART AF): Specific targets include "Ensure 90% onboarding checklist completion within 72 hours of joining," "Achieve 75% first-week activity rate," "Generate 1 qualitative feedback point per new member in the first week," and "Attain 100% Slack + Coda access within 24h of invite."
◦
Stage-by-Stage Plan: The execution plan breaks down actions for mentees and mentors across Day 0-1, Day 1-2, Week 1+, and the Retention Loop (Week 3+). This includes receiving invites, completing checklists, engaging in specific channels, and receiving personalized follow-ups.
◦
Required Access: Ensuring "100% Slack + Coda access within 24h of invite" is a key operational goal.
4.
Intentional Community Culture & Engagement Strategies: Beyond onboarding, the documentation highlights the importance of fostering a specific community culture through intentional engagement and communication.
◦
Intro Frameworks: Creative methods like the "3-Layer Cake" Intro ("Fun Fluff," "Substance," "Realness") and "Icebreaker Roulette" are proposed to encourage personality-rich introductions.
◦
Engagement Prompts: Message templates are provided for "Supportive Mentor-Style Thread Reply," "Sassy Check-in Prompt," and "Curiosity-Driven Feedback Bait." The use of humor and memes is explicitly encouraged.
◦
Highlighting Members: Showcasing "BEST ENGAGERS TO STUDY + STEAL FROM" and using "Brag Bites: Show Off Your Spark" sections or "Mentor Spotlight Moments" are suggested to celebrate member contributions and model desired behavior.
◦
Values Integration: Integrating community values into onboarding materials and reinforcing them through community-wide messages and behavior modeling is recommended.
5.
Feedback Collection and Action: A structured process for gathering, analyzing, and acting upon member feedback is outlined.
◦
Methods: This includes in-depth member interviews, quick surveys, feedback forms (including for declining engagement and formal exits), and leveraging reactions or quotes from platform discussions.
◦
Analysis Framework: A "Weekly Synthesis Process" involves "Collection & Categorization," "Pattern Identification," "Impact Assessment," "Action Planning" (Quick wins, Strategic initiatives, etc.), and "Closing the Loop" with members.
◦
Feedback-to-Action Pipeline: Establishing an internal system with SLAs for translating feedback into concrete actions and reporting back to participants is a key deliverable in the Community Engagement Specialist roadmap.
6.
Mentor Attraction and Management: Specific consideration is given to attracting and supporting mentors, recognizing their unique needs and motivations.
◦
Mentor Needs & Desires: Mentors are described as "busy," "established," and seeking "empowerment, growth, and challenge." They want to "be part of something bigger" and engage with a community that aligns with their "personal values and growth-oriented missions."
◦
Attraction Strategy: The community brand purpose should explicitly resonate with leaders and mentors, focusing on "leadership development, life-changing advice, or personal growth." Relevance to the mentor's field of expertise is crucial.
◦
Mentor Metrics: Specific KPIs for mentors include "Mentee Response Rate <48h," "First Engagement in <3 days," "Feedback Quality Rating (Peer)," "Mentor Pulse Participation," and "Contribution to Knowledge Base."
◦
Mentor-Mentee Matching: Defining and categorizing key traits (Personality, Risk Tolerance, Communication Style, Learning Style) and using a "Compatibility Matrix" is suggested for effective matching. Pairing complementary types (e.g., "Risk-Averse Mentor + Risk-Taking Mentee") is seen as beneficial.
◦
Mentor Support: Providing a "Mentor Toolkit," DM prompts, and guidance on spotting and handling "ghosting" mentees are suggested support mechanisms.
7.
Re-Engagement Strategy: Specific tactics and automation are proposed for members who become inactive ("ghosting").
◦
Playbook & Tactics: The "Re-engagement Playbook" includes timed nudges (Day 5 Public Nudge, Day 7 FOMO Bomb), often employing humor or exclusive invites.
◦
Automation: Utilizing a "Ghost Tracker View" in Coda, Zapier triggers for inactivity ("No activity in 7d" → Slack DM), and Trello automation ("No checklist progress in 5d" → Email Reminder) are key automated steps.
◦
Re-engagement Goals: Metrics include "Re-engagement Response Rate (50% Goal)," "Ghost-to-Checklist Conversion (30% Goal)," and "Post-Reactivation Slack Action (1+ action Goal)."
◦
Bonus Moves: Ideas like a "Comeback Kid" badge, a "Ghostbusters Club" mini-challenge (reviving other ghosts), and a "#resurrected-legends" channel are proposed.
8.
Tooling & Automation: The strategy relies heavily on integrating and automating workflows across multiple platforms.
◦
Primary Tools: Coda (tracker, dashboards, potentially content hub), Trello (gamified flow, automation), Slack (communication, bots, prompts), Google Sheets/Notion (dashboards, templates), Zapier (automation triggers), Canva (identity card generation).
◦
Integrations: Optional integrations include AI Column (Summarize onboarding vibe), Sync with Trello (Checklist sync), Feedback Digest export (Notion or Slack).
◦
Workflow Automation: Automating invites, reminders, metric tracking, and re-engagement pings are integral to the plan.
9.
Distinctive Tone and Voice: The documentation frequently employs a playful, slightly sarcastic, and high-energy tone, often addressing the reader directly as "Miss Big Brain," "Nerdzilla," or "Queen of Community Engagement."
◦
Voice Tweaks: Suggestions are provided for adjusting the voice to be "Professional" (Clear, concise, active voice) while remaining "Approachable" (Keep fun elements, soften aggressive humor, friendly language).
◦
Examples: The contrast between an "Original" Trello explanation ("glitter and threats") and a "Refined" version ("a little sparkle and a lot of structure") illustrates this.
◦
Goal: This tone is intended to be "хем забавен, хем целенасочен" and act as an "антидот на скучните onboarding гайдове."
