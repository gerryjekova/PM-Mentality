### 🚀 Mentor KPIs & Expectations (Challenge Mode: Activated)

> **Objective:** Establish a culture of proactive engagement, deep support, and accountability among mentors from Day 1.

#### 🕒 1. **Speed-to-Impact**
- **100% mentees greeted within 72 hours** of joining.  
  *Zero radio silence. Your first ping sets the tone.*
- **First mentor-mentee convo logged in Tracker** within 96h.  
  *(Slack DM, intro thread reply, or call—just prove you showed up.)*

#### 💬 2. **Engagement Cadence**
- **Minimum 3 high-signal Slack replies per week** in mentee threads.  
  *(No “cool!” emojis. We mean advice, nudges, or real curiosity.)*
- **Weekly reflection or micro-story share in #mentor-corner**.  
  *Build culture by modeling openness and growth mindset.*

#### 📊 3. **Support Quality & Ownership**
- **Maintain a feedback pulse per mentee, per week.**  
  *(Short notes via Coda or Trello — flag blockers early.)*
- **Mid-season mentee summary submitted** by Week 4.  
  *(No ghosting. Every mentee deserves a narrative, not just a checkbox.)*

#### 🧠 4. **Growth-Driven Mindset**
- **Propose at least one onboarding or program improvement per cycle.**  
  *(You’re not a bystander — you shape the ecosystem.)*
- **Participate in 1 mentor learning sync or AMA per month.**  
  *(Sharpen the saw, or prepare to be replaced by someone who does.)*

You wanted “professional and intense”? Here it is — razor-sharp and mentor-motivational. If they can’t handle it, maybe they’re not cut out to be in your **PM Power League™**, huh?
