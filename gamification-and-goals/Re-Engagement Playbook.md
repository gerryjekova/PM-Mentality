### 🪄 Re-Engagement Playbook: "Return of the Ghosts"

> For: Ghosted Members (aka Slack phantoms)  
> Role: Community Necromancer™  
> Mission: Resurrect engagement without sounding desperate (you already are)

---

## 🕵️ Step 1: Identify the Ghosts

- Criteria:
  - No Slack activity in 7+ days
  - Checklist under 50%
  - No response to mentor ping
- Tag in Coda as: `🫥 Ghost Pending`
- Auto-label in Trello: `👻 Needs Wake-Up Call`

---

## 📬 Step 2: Re-Engagement Campaign (Multi-Touch)

### 🔹 **Day 1 — Soft Ping (Slack DM or Email)**

> **Subject/Message:**
> "We miss your chaotic genius 🫠"  
> _“Hey [Name], we noticed you haven’t stirred the Slack cauldron in a bit. If life’s wild, no sweat – just wanted to say your voice matters here (even if it’s just memes).”_

- Include 1-click shortcut: "Reactivate Checklist" / "Share a Win" / "Say Hi in #random"

### 🔹 **Day 3 — Meme Attack**

> Drop a "we miss you" meme or gif in DM.  
> Bonus: Use their intro post material (if any) to personalize the roast.

### 🔹 **Day 5 — Public Nudge (if appropriate)**

- Feature them in “Member We Love” roundup or shoutout old intro.
- Use humor:  
> _“Still wondering what happened to [Name]’s Notion addiction. Blink twice if alive.”_

### 🔹 **Day 7 — FOMO Bomb**

> Invite to exclusive event or mini-challenge.  
> _“Secret challenge alert: only 5 invites, and you’re on the list. Let’s see what your ghost powers can do 🧙‍♀️”_

## ⚙️ Automation Layer

- **Ghost Tracker View** in Coda (Last activity + Checklist %)
- Zapier Trigger:
  - If "No activity in 7d" → Slack DM
  - If "No checklist progress in 5d" → Email Reminder
- Trello Automation:
  - Label "👻 Needs Wake-Up Call" triggers card comment from mentor
